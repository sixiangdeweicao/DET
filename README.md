# DET
Efficient IPv6 address discovery algorithm DET which combines density, information entropy and space tree.  DET is short for detective, which means that  discovery new active IPv6 addresses  in the IPv6 address space.

## Dependencies and installation
DET is compateible with Python3.x. You can install the requirements for your version. Besides, DET uses the following packages:
 
* argparse
```
pip3 install argparse
```

## zmapv6 installation (ask in IPv4 network)

###  Building from Source

```
git clone https://github.com/tumi8/zmap.git
cd zmap
```
### Installing ZMap Dependencies

On Debian-based systems (including Ubuntu):
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libgmp3-dev gengetopt libpcap-dev flex byacc libjson-c-dev pkg-config libunistring-dev
```

On RHEL- and Fedora-based systems (including CentOS):
```
sudo yum install cmake gmp-devel gengetopt libpcap-devel flex byacc json-c-devel libunistring-devel
```

On macOS systems (using Homebrew):
```
brew install pkg-config cmake gmp gengetopt json-c byacc libdnet libunistring
```

### Building and Installing ZMap

```
cmake .
make -j4
sudo make install
```

## Usage
Parameter meaning introduction：
* input:  type=str, input IPv6 addresses
* output: type=str,output directory name
* budget: type=int,the upperbound of scan times
* IPv6:   type=str,local IPv6 address
* delta:  type=int, default =16, the base of address
* beta:   type=int, default=16,the max of node

running example
```
sudo python3 --input=DataDir/yourdata --output=StoreDir --budget=500  --IPv6=loacl Ipv6 address --delta=16 --beta=16
```
# Data
In order to support IPv6 network related research, we provide more data about hitlist(active IPv6 addresses) and address fingerprint information.

If you want more data, you can send a request to sgl18@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn. 

The request should include the work department, the purpose of data usage, and the data content obtained.
